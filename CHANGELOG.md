## [Unreleased]

> **Session 2026-05-24/25 (dashboard polish + #83 HuggingFace archive live + privacy hardening + ROI panels):** Very large multi-track session; all code delegated to `fixer` agents in isolated worktrees, every change PR'd + `pr-checks`-gated (new CI workflow, #198). ~24 PRs merged. **Stale-email fix (#174):** daily email showed 4-day-stale data — push silently rejected (no `pipefail`) + file-mtime used as the data timestamp; fixed with `git fetch`+`reset --hard origin/main` self-heal, `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` push-exit check, and a data-age timestamp taken from the newest record. **Dashboard:** consolidated to 4 nav items via tabsets (#178, closes #175); Glossary architecture/workflow/datasets mermaid diagrams (#180/#191) + black-node-text & multi-line-label fix — root cause was bslib `fg=#e0e0e0` cascading into the foreignObject `<p>` plus `white-space:nowrap`/`max-width` truncation, fixed via foreignObject CSS + `<br/>` labels (#202, closes #176); Metric Definitions tabset (#188); roborev Pulse + cross-tool cost panels (#193); DuckDB-WASM `sessions.parquet` path fix (#200); 2 charts migrated JSON-fetch→DuckDB-WASM (#213 Conversations-Over-Time, #223 Session-Duration — #83 Phase 5). **PRIVACY INCIDENT (found + closed + verified):** the public v1 `sessions.parquet` contained 15 `mycare` + 3 crypto rows — root cause: `rollup_*` built the parquet WITHOUT `clean_projects()` (the filter lived only in the export script), the deploy privacy gate scanned JSON not parquet, and short-name forms (`solwatch`/`swarms`) bypassed exact-name exclusion. Fixed: data-layer `drop_confidential_projects()` inside both the rollups AND the staging-drain appenders (#203, #221 — closing the #83 Phase A drain gap that re-leaked a mycare row), short-forms added, a parquet deploy-gate added; verified 0 confidential live. #204 tracks the git-history residue (accepted, metadata-only). **Project-name cleanup (#205):** 38 noisy → 18 clean projects; worktree/branch fragments (`llm-feat-cc-*`→`llm`) folded, an `agent-tooling` bucket for agent sessions, user-confirmed `demos`/`wiki` dropped + `hartree`/`maps`/`tlang` kept. **#83 epic — HF archive LIVE:** PIT cost appender (#201, Phase A), historical backfill (#203, Phase C), `hf upload` push mechanism (#206, Phase D), scheduled nightly workflow (#209, Phase F), parquet-freshness wired into the export pipeline (#221, #210). `JohnGavin/llmtelemetry-metrics` now carries sanitised `sessions.parquet` + `costs.parquet`. **#146 ROI panels:** groomed (all 5 `roborev_*` tables are populated — backlog unblocked); shipped Q5 resolution-rate (#222, 74.4%) + Q10 agent pass-rate (#224). **Ops:** branch protection enabled (Option 2); root `*.sh`→`scripts/` (#199); HF dataset repo created. Filed #207, #210, llm#299 (HF-upload rule outdated for CI), llm#304 (SendMessage isolation), commented llm#235 (self-review PATH bug). Cleanup: 58 agent worktrees pruned; orchestrator branch realigned.
>
> **Failed approaches this session:**
> - HF git-over-HTTPS basic-auth is REJECTED in CI ("Password authentication no longer supported", with both token-as-username and account-as-username) — 9 failed runs. The `huggingface-upload` rule's git+lfs path works only locally (post-`huggingface-cli login` credential helper). Pivoted to `hf upload` (huggingface_hub CLI, `HF_TOKEN` env). Also discovered: `huggingface-cli` is now a deprecated no-op (use `hf`); R `system2()` does not shell-quote (a multi-word commit message split into stray args); and the secret initially held an invalid token (401). Captured in memory + llm#299.
> - SendMessage to CONTINUE a fixer broke worktree isolation TWICE — the continuation ran in the orchestrator checkout and committed to the session branch (once on a 40-commits-stale base, re-creating files already on main). Fresh `isolation:"worktree"` dispatches were always reliable. Lesson: no SendMessage for write-continuations (llm#304); the tainted #220 was superseded by a clean #221.
> - First parquet-freshness attempt (#220) regenerated the parquet but the staging-drain appender (no confidential filter) re-introduced a `mycare` row — caught before merge, redone cleanly as #221.
>
> **Accuracy / Metrics:**
> - ~24 PRs merged, all `pr-checks`-gated; live `sessions.parquet` verified 0 confidential (was 15 mycare + 3 crypto).
> - Projects: 38 noisy → 18 clean; roborev resolution rate 74.4% (clean repos, 2074/2788); agent pass-rates claude-code 25.1% / codex 22.3% / gemini 11.1%.
> - HF archive live (run #10 success): `sessions.parquet` 11.3 KB + `costs.parquet` 3.5 KB on the Hub.
> - Issues: #175/#176 closed; #146 partially shipped (Q5/Q10, stays open as living backlog); #204/#207/#210 filed.
>
> **Known Limitations (next session):**
> - **Branch protection (`enforce_admins=true`) will BLOCK the automated push scripts.** `refresh_and_preserve.sh` (12-hourly launchd) and `export_and_deploy_data.sh` (session-end) both `git push origin main` directly and will now FAIL against protected `main`. Recommend `enforce_admins=false` (keep block-force-push + block-deletion + require `pr-checks` — the PR requirement still guards). **Resolve before the next automated refresh, or those pushes silently stop publishing.**
> - HF nightly push only changes the dataset when the committed parquet changes; the parquet now regenerates via the session-end/manual export pipeline (#221), NOT the 12-hourly cron — freshness tracks session-end exports.
> - #146 commit-link questions (Q4 time-to-fix, Q9 false-positive, Q14 loop-closure) still blocked on finding→fix enrichment (`close_reason` is only `manual`/NULL).
> - #207 self-review dashboard blocked on the llm#235 launchd PATH bug (an `llm`-session fix).
> - roborev lifetime backlog: 261 failed / 101 addressed (project-wide, not this session's changes).
> - Untracked scratch in the working tree: `ONBOARDING.md` (parked team-onboarding guide), `decomp_83.md`, `proposal.md`.

> **Session 2026-05-23 (dashboard prod repair + roborev-backlog clear + privacy hardening):** Long multi-track session, all work delegated to `fixer` agents in isolated worktrees and gated by roborev (agent: codex) review before every merge — 16 PRs merged, ~14 issues closed. **Dashboard repair chain (prod was down):** `:156` parse error from embedded-JS quote escaping in the `{shinylive-r}` chunk (`HTML('...')` single-quoted string broken by literal `'`) — PR #158; data 404 everywhere from worker-relative `base_url` (`"data/"` resolves against the WebR worker script path, not the page) → origin-absolute `/llmtelemetry/data/` — PR #161; empty Time Blocks + stale (2026-05-19) sessions fixed by a local data refresh (real cmonitor-rs blocks 1,916; fresh `unified_sessions` 341 through 2026-05-23) + a CI blocks-fallback that copies the committed snapshot — PR #163; roborev "Reviews" page (#144) — PR #162; `:98 Unexpected string` from `["importScripts(\"" ...]` (R unescapes `\"`→`"`, breaking the DuckDB-WASM worker) — PR #166. All verified live. **roborev backlog (#137–#141):** email NaN false-positive (`grep -ci` matched "nan" substrings) + QA-gate-ran-post-send ordering — PR #153; `refresh_codex_cache.R` rotated-log replay-from-byte-0 + slice-as-replacement → per-file content-fingerprint offsets + additive NA-safe merge — PR #152 (closes the 2026-05-20 HIGH); sanitizer privacy leak → single source of truth `R/sensitive_patterns.R`, re-sanitized 2 leaked extdata files — PR #151 (closes 2026-05-20 HIGH); ccusage_blocks CI export determinism + schema gate — PR #150. **#145/#144 salvaged:** substantial uncommitted roborev-dashboard WIP recovered from 2 stale worktrees → scraper/read-layer (PR #160, 3 rounds) + page/plots (PR #162). **Outage prevention #159:** CI guard parses every `{shinylive-r}` chunk pre-deploy (PR #171) — verified live; the #156 class can no longer ship silently. **Privacy hardening:** gate now catches any-user `/Users/` + non-tmp `/private/` incl. bare forms (#157, PR #170, 3 rounds); batched validation/test hardening (#154/#155/#168, PR #169). **Caught + contained a hex-encoded `/Users/…` path leak** in `codex_log_offsets.json` (untracked + gitignored + `.Rbuildignore` + a hex-decode privacy test) before it reached main — roborev found it after a plain-text grep + the agent's own gate missed it. **Cleanup:** 22 stale worktrees removed (guard correctly skipped dirty ones, preserving the WIP above); #135/#136 closed as superseded by merged #134; #147 closed (its actions done). Filed **llm#273** (coordinated emit-hook concurrency fix) + scheduled a 2026-05-25 reminder for #83 Phase 4 (#149 tracker).
>
> **Failed approaches this session:**
> - Misdiagnosed the dashboard no-data as a stale service worker (SW console errors + `curl` 200 on the data files pointed there). An Incognito test disproved it — root cause was the worker-relative `base_url`. Lesson: WebR `download.file` resolves relative URLs against the Web Worker script path, not the page; use origin-absolute paths.
> - #135/#136 (codex round-V alternatives) could not be salvaged by rebase — superseded by merged #134 + this session's rewrites of the same files (`git cherry`: 12/14 and 4/6 already applied); closed as superseded after verifying main already has the M7 `.GlobalEnv` teardown.
>
> **Accuracy / Metrics:**
> - main test suite green (1486+ passing, 0 failing) after #167 repaired the export-test regression introduced by #163.
> - Every merged PR roborev-reviewed to clean, most over 2–4 rounds (it caught a real bug each round: the #150 in-script-QA HIGH, #152 multi-gen rotation duplicate, #151/#157 privacy gaps, #163 hex leak, #160 plan/binary integration bugs, #159 multi-chunk guard hole).
> - Resolves the 4 "Known Limitations" logged 2026-05-20 (refresh_codex merge HIGH, export hash format, canonicalize nested paths, fallback_map test).
>
> **Known Limitations (next session):**
> - Emit-hook concurrency: global `/bye` sentinel + unstable fallback session id corrupt telemetry under concurrent sessions (likely cause of the `—` durations on the Sessions page). Cross-project fix tracked in **llm#273**; PR #132 parked (draft) until the `llm`-side `/bye` producer + live hook land.
> - roborev dashboard panels render but show no data until **llm#226** lands the 5 `unified.duckdb` tables (read fns degrade gracefully to empty).
> - #83 Phase 4 (backfill) gated to 2026-05-25 (local run); #149 verifies the reminder routine fired.
> - main checkout carries uncommitted local `inst/extdata/*.json` (auto-refresh cmonitor data) — separate from this session's PR-based data refresh; needs a sanitized commit if it's to be published.

> **Session 2026-05-20 evening (codex-epic followup + process work):** Closed all 3 decision-needed priorities from prior session. **U (codex-epic fixes, `8ebb198`):** 6 post-merge roborev findings fixed in one cluster — `refresh_codex_cache.R` fallback canonicalizer walks all `docs_gh/`-suffix segments past container prefixes (`data`, `finance`, `stats`, `pers`, `proj`, `.claude`); `digest` added to DESCRIPTION Imports; roborev source attribution keyed on join-success not `repo_id` non-NA; email "Sessions" metric uses `n_distinct(thread_id)` from `codex_s`; dashboard Sessions KPI includes codex; new `codex_d_proj` reactive applies project filter to codex weekly charts. 4 new regression tests; 762 total passing. **V (#83 epic audit):** all 7 epic branches classified OBSOLETE — squash-merged via PRs #84–#90 plus 2 direct commits between 2026-05-16 and 2026-05-18; deleted. Phase 4 (backfill, due 2026-05-25) starts fresh from current main. **#129 closed:** `branch-salvage-workflow` rule + `branch-cherry-check.sh` helper landed in `JohnGavin/llm@cb7d907`. 3-step pre-salvage check (patch-id + closing-PR + unique-strings) catches squash-merge and re-implementation cases that `git cherry` alone misses. **llm#191 Tier 3 shipped:** `JohnGavin/llm@bd46d50` extends `auto-delegation` with post-agent verification pattern; `agent-post-verify.sh` provides capture/check semantics with drift classification + recovery instructions; logs to `~/.claude/logs/worktree_post_verify.log` for empirical baseline. Tier 1 prompt-prefix has now held across 4 consecutive agent dispatches (R, T, U, V) — self-check lines confirm worktree boundary respected. **Worktree cleanup:** llmtelemetry branch list is now `* main` only.
>
> **Failed approaches this session:** none — all tracks delivered cleanly. The new worktree-isolation prefix (just shipped in `d7f58d9`) was validated immediately by U and V — both agents' self-check confirmed `pwd` under `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` and branch != `main`.
>
> **Accuracy / Metrics:**
> - Tests: 717 → 762 (+45 new in U: canonicalize nested paths, roborev attribution with NA repo_id, email session-count with codex_s fixture, dashboard codex_d_proj project filter)
> - Open issues llmtelemetry: 3 → 1 (#83 epic remains, decoupled from stale branches)
> - Open issues llm: 2 unchanged (#182 inverse case, #191 Tier 2/4 remain)
> - Open roborev reviews: 50 → 93 (each push triggers fresh review; new findings flagged against the U-merged state — see Known Limitations)
> - Local branches llmtelemetry: 7 stale + main → main only
>
> **Known Limitations (4 new roborev findings against U-merged state):**
> - HIGH: `inst/scripts/refresh_codex_cache.R:603-645` — incremental refresh overwrites existing aggregates instead of merging additively. Re-running for same thread/day discards earlier turns. Fix: merge overlapping keys additively or rebuild affected thread/day from a complete source window.
> - HIGH: `inst/scripts/export_dashboard_data.R:146-167` + `R/rollup_sessions.R:195-268` — public export still writes OLD hash format (6-digit decimal) while staged rollups now use ISO-8601 + 12-char hex per Agent C's #114 fix. `append_sessions_from_staging()` deduplication is broken across these two formats.
> - MEDIUM: `R/canonicalize.R:44-67` + `refresh_codex_cache.R:82-95` — nested underscore-form paths still miscanonicalized. Example: `.../proj/data/weather/irish_buoy_network/irishbuoys` → `weather` instead of `irish_buoy_network`. Beyond U's container-prefix walk.
> - LOW: `tests/testthat/test-export-dashboard-data.R:383-389` — CI fallback regression test skips unconditionally because `fallback_map` no longer exists in export script.

> **Session 2026-05-19/20 (roborev triage + codex coverage epic):** Shipped a long multi-track session across 2 days. **Roborev cleanup:** 50+21+3 reviews closed against the latest 6-merge fix series; 13 duplicate GitHub issues closed (#113, #114, #115, #117, #116, #118, #119–#128) with merge-commit references. **Privacy regression (#131):** Agent A sanitized `_all` JSON snapshots; the 12-hourly launchd cron at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.johngavin.llmtelemetry.refresh.plist → /Users/johngavin/docs_gh/proj/data/llm/telemetry/exec/refresh_and_preserve.sh` re-introduced 190+29 leaks 4 hours later. Fix landed in 2 commits: `c38f78d` added `inst/scripts/sanitize_ccusage_all.R` + 22 regression tests + restored snapshots; `6b6f814` (in the external repo, same `JohnGavin/llmtelemetry.git` remote) added a fail-closed Tier 3c sanitization step to the cron script. Verified clean against the 02:43 natural cron cycle (`1ddcbe4`); #131 closed. **Codex coverage (#72/#130):** Investigation found `~/.codex/log/codex-tui.log` is OTEL-structured with full per-turn token usage; thread_id joins with roborev DB for repo attribution. R (`feat/codex-telemetry-ingestion`, 43 tests) added `inst/scripts/refresh_codex_cache.R` + `inst/extdata/codex_pricing.json` + `codex_daily.json`/`codex_sessions.json` + hook into `export_dashboard_data.R`. T extended `send_daily_email.R` with codex row + "Codex by Automation Type" (roborev/interactive split). S extended `dashboard_shinylive.qmd` with `SOURCE_PALETTE` (claude `#d97757` / gemini `#4285f4` / codex `#10a37f`) across 6 chart sites; closed #72 and #130. **Stale branch cleanup:** 14 unmerged `fix/*` branches triaged — 4 superseded discarded, 2 already-applied (git cherry) deleted, 2 OT-investigation archived with comments on closed #58/#59, 1 ARIA no-op (already squash-merged via #64) discarded, 1 byte-order sort salvaged into commit fixing both #116 + #117. Remaining 7 branches are all `#83` epic phases (kept). **Process findings filed in llm repo:** #182 (sandbox over-restricts authorized external writes); #191 (sandbox under-restricts — agents D/F/S silently committed to main checkout); Tier 1 of #191 already shipped as `d7f58d9` (worktree-isolation prefix in `auto-delegation` rule). **#129 filed** with git-cherry methodology refinement (squash-merge limitation discovered when 4 of 6 "salvage candidates" turned out to be no-ops — patch-id matching can't catch squash-merge).
>
> **Failed approaches this session:**
> - Agent G blocked by sandbox on Bash for protected paths (`inst/extdata/`) — orchestrator took over read-only audit; turned out parquets were already clean (test-no-path-leak.R already covered them at lines 51-68).
> - Agent F's "ARIA rebase" produced an empty diff — content was already in main via squash-merge `469d709` (#64); `git cherry` patch-id check did NOT detect this — squash-merge breaks patch-id matching.
> - Agent P sandbox-blocked from writing to authorized external path `/Users/johngavin/docs_gh/proj/data/llm/telemetry/exec/refresh_and_preserve.sh` even with explicit prompt-level authorization — orchestrator took over.
> - Agent S committed directly to `main` branch in its worktree instead of the requested feature branch (filed as #191 in llm repo).
>
> **Accuracy / Metrics:**
> - Tests: 717 → 717 + 43 (codex ingestion) + 23 (codex email) + 9 (dashboard codex) + 22 (sanitizer regression) = 814 passing (1 pre-existing skip)
> - Open issues: 17 → 3 (#129 methodology, #83 epic, #133 closed stub for cross-link)
> - Open roborev reviews: 51 → 50 (each push triggers fresh review; current 50 reflect findings against the JUST-MERGED codex epic — see Known Limitations)
>
> **Known Limitations (open roborev findings against the codex epic):**
> - HIGH: `refresh_codex_cache.R:27-47` — standalone fallback canonicalizer returns container segments (`data`) for nested `proj/data/...` paths; reuse package canonicalizer or strip known container prefixes
> - MEDIUM: `sanitize_ccusage_all.R:109-110` — `digest::digest()` called unconditionally but `digest` not in DESCRIPTION; will fail in clean CI/Nix
> - MEDIUM: `refresh_codex_cache.R:459-462` — roborev attribution keyed on `repo_id` non-NA rather than join-success; matched rows with missing repo_id silently classified as "interactive"
> - MEDIUM: `send_daily_email.R:661-668` — "Codex by Automation Type" "Sessions" column uses `n()` over daily-aggregated `codex_d` rather than distinct `thread_id` in `codex_s` (over-counts)
> - MEDIUM: `dashboard_shinylive.qmd:1281-1289` — Sessions KPI counts only Claude+Gemini, misses codex
> - MEDIUM: `dashboard_shinylive.qmd:1171-1173,1602-1607` — Codex weekly chart uses `codex_d()` without project filter while Claude uses `cc_d_proj()` — filtered Claude compared against all-project Codex

> **Session 2026-05-18 (roborev triage + #112 hotfix):** Job 3002 found a High bug introduced in Phase 2B: DuckDB IN clause built with `JSON.stringify()` producing double-quoted identifiers instead of single-quoted SQL string literals — project filter was silently broken for any non-null selection. Fixed in 56c8018 (#112 closed). Filed #113 (resolve_sel/__ALL__ drops projects missing from projects_master), #114 (session_id hash collision risk, 1M space), #115 (ccusage_*_all.json exposes raw filesystem paths in public extdata). Jobs 3009/3015/3021/3027 triaged and closed against #113/#114/#115. Roborev resolution rate: 163/168 addressed.

> **Session 2026-05-18 (7-issue bug-fix blitz):** Closed #105, #107, #108, #111, #106, #110, #109 in parallel across two batches. #105: CI workflow removed guaranteed-404 validation of `_site/dashboard_shinylive.html` (dashboard is published as index.html only). #107: `output$cost_by_model` now uses `cc_d()` directly — `cc_d_proj()` routed through `tok_proj` which lacks `modelsUsed`/`totalCost`. #108: `aggregate()` step added after `canonicalize_session_project()` in cost and token exports — collapses duplicate (canonical_project, date) rows created when multiple raw aliases map to the same canonical name. #111: `unified_sessions` read split into two steps to emit `message()` count before the silent `pmax()` clamp of `ended_at < started_at`. #106: `"irishbuoys" = "irish_buoy_network"` added to `canonicalize_project()` overrides (dash-form was missing; only slash-form `"buoy/network"` was handled); mycare restored to `tracked_repos`. #110: session dedup now uses row-number tiebreaker — last-appended row wins when `started_at` ties, replacing the unreliable `distinct()` sort order. #109: `poll_github_events.R` parse-error handler sets `parse_failed <<- TRUE`; next line returns `load_previous()` immediately, discarding partial in-memory pages. All 7 commits pushed to main.

> **Session 2026-05-18 (Phase 3 hook deployment):** `~/.claude/hooks/llmtelemetry_emit.sh` deployed — two modes (start/stop), JSONL envelope to `~/.claude/logs/llmtelemetry-staging/events-HOST-DATE.jsonl`, duration computed via python3 (portable). Three projects opted in via flag files (llm, llmtelemetry, irishbuoys). `settings.json` wired to SessionStart + Stop events. End-to-end test: 224→231 rows in parquet from 7 staged events. 1-week observation window begins 2026-05-25 before Phase 4 backfill.

> **Session 2026-05-18 (Phase 2B + issue group blitz):** Phase 2B complete: Sessions by Project chart now fully reactive — DuckDB-WASM SQL carries `started_at >= cutoff` alongside project IN clause; `observe()` now reads `cutoff()` so date horizon changes re-query; chart colour corrected from Gemini red to Claude blue. v1 parquets refreshed: sessions 202→224, git_commits 860→1553. Phase 2 of Epic #83 is done.

> **Session 2026-05-18 (issue group blitz):** Closed 7 issues. #81: corrected `tracked_repos` paths in `export_dashboard_data.R` (irishbuoys/footbet pointed at non-existent dirs). #78: verified Gemini telemetry is current; CLI last used Feb 2026, closed as expected behaviour. #80: `output$cost_cumulative` now sources from `cost_by_project_estimated.json` for project-aware cumulative cost; new `proj_cost_cumulative` chart added to By Project tab. #74: Git tab restructured with `navset_tab()` into "Velocity" and "Code Health" sub-tabs. #75: `card_footer()` added to Overview Summary, Sessions Summary, Git Summary cards. #70: Glossary hyperlinks added (Cache, Bus Factor, Churn, TODO/FIXME, Brier Score, Calibration, API Conversation, Block); new Tools section. #79: `tokens_by_project.json` export added (72 rows, duration-weight approach matching cost estimates); `cc_d_proj()` reactive now project-aware; Token Analysis charts respect project filter.

> **Session 2026-05-17 evening (roborev fixes):** Fixed 2 roborev findings. #2181: moved "Check rendered HTML" step in `deploy-dashboard.yaml` to BEFORE `upload-pages-artifact` so a broken dashboard cannot be uploaded before the check fires. #2191: added `@k{n}` counter suffix to sanitized session_ids in `rollup_sessions.R` for collision resistance; fixed `distinct()` sort order to keep the most-recent row (sort DESC before distinct, not after).

> **Session 2026-05-17 (PR merge + cleanup):** Merged all 12 roborev-backlog PRs (#93–#104) into main via sequential local integration merge with 4 manual conflict resolutions. Cleaned up 3 agent worktrees (199MB), deleted 12 remote branches. Key conflict resolutions: (1) `poll_github_events.R` — combined #94 exit-status fallback with #100 per-repo `load_previous()` filter; (2) extdata JSONs — took PR #101 privacy-sanitized versions; (3) dashboard ECharts graph — kept `name=f` (full path) from #103 to match edge keys. CI triggered (run 25996149508). Epic #83 Phase 2B (DuckDB-WASM chart integration) is next.

> **Session 2026-05-16 evening (telemetry epic Phase 1 complete):** Phase 1A-F + Phase 2A landed across 6 merged PRs (#85, #86, #87, #88, #90, #91). Push pipeline closed for all 3 v1 tables (sessions, costs, git_commits). DuckDB-WASM pilot proved end-to-end browser query against real parquet in 539 ms cold (Q3 from Phase 0 verified). Privacy fix PR #91 closes roborev #936. Roborev #905 closed (verified PR #62 fix). Issue #58 closed with synthesis. Filed #92 (ccusage_daily.json contains stderr text instead of JSON — likely root cause of roborev #948's reported symptom). Tests: 28 → 543 (+515). DESCRIPTION: 0.1.0 → 0.5.1.

### Privacy fix — closes roborev #936 (PR #N)
- `sanitize_for_public()` helper added to `inst/scripts/export_dashboard_data.R`
- Replaces raw `project` column with `canonical_project` before every write to `inst/extdata/`
- Drops rows where `canonical_project IS NA` (orphan/agent-worktree rows that have no canonical project)
- Sanitizes path-style `session_id` values (e.g. `-Users-johngavin-docs-gh-llm`) with a deterministic synthetic id built from `canonical_project@started_at`
- Drops `project_slug` from `predictions.json` (raw filesystem path column)
- All 7 affected committed JSONs regenerated clean: unified_sessions (136 orphans dropped), cost_by_project_estimated (37 dropped), cost_per_commit (0 dropped), weekly_commits_by_project (0 dropped), git_commits_by_project (0 dropped), file_churn (0 dropped), change_coupling (0 dropped)
- v1 parquets regenerated clean (sessions 329→202 rows, costs 108→68 rows, git_commits 860 rows unchanged)
- New `tests/testthat/test-no-path-leak.R` — 145 assertions blocking regressions across all JSON and Parquet extdata files
- Version bumped to 0.5.1

### Phase 2A of epic #83 (DRAFT PR)
- `vignettes/dashboard_v1_pilot.qmd`: pilot demonstrating DuckDB-WASM querying real v1 sessions parquet (329 rows) rendered to ECharts horizontal bar chart — pure JS, no R reactivity
- `.gitignore`: `vignettes/data/` already excluded (served copies are not source-of-truth)
- `scripts/serve_pilot.sh`: convenience runner — copies parquet, starts python3 http.server on port 8900
- Phase 2B will integrate this pattern into the main dashboard with project-filter reactivity

### Phase 1F of epic #83 (PR #N)
- Refactor: `.canonicalize_project_local()` moved to `R/canonicalize.R` as shared internal helper (used by all 3 appenders)
- New function: `append_costs_from_staging()` — consumes `cost_emitted` events into v1 costs parquet; dedup by `cost_id = paste(canonical_project, date, source, sep="|")`
- New function: `append_git_commits_from_staging()` — consumes `git_commit` events into v1 git_commits parquet; dedup by `commit_pk = paste(canonical_project, hash, sep="|")`
- `inst/schema/v1/events.md` updated with full payload specs for `cost_emitted` and `git_commit`
- `inst/scripts/run_rollup.R` now drains staging for all 3 tables (sessions, costs, git_commits)
- 30 tests in `tests/testthat/test-append-costs-from-staging.R`; 35 tests in `tests/testthat/test-append-git-commits-from-staging.R`
- Version bumped to 0.5.0

### Phase 1E of epic #83 (PR #N)
- New function: `append_sessions_from_staging()` — consumes hook events into v1 sessions parquet
- Dedup by `session_id`; idempotent (running twice yields identical row count)
- Event envelope schema documented at `inst/schema/v1/events.md`
- `inst/scripts/run_rollup.R` now also drains the staging dir after backfills
- 31 tests in `tests/testthat/test-append-from-staging.R`
- Version bumped to 0.4.0

### Phase 1B/C/D of epic #83 (PR #86)

- New tables: costs (Phase 1B), git_commits (Phase 1C)
- New rollups: `rollup_costs()` from `cost_by_project_estimated.json` (72 rows)
- New rollups: `rollup_git_commits()` from `git_commits_by_project.json` (837 rows)
- Push hook: `inst/hooks/llmtelemetry_emit.sh` appends events to staging JSONL
- Staging reader: `R/read_staging.R` — `read_staging()` returns tibble of staged events
- `inst/scripts/run_rollup.R` now executes all 3 rollups
- Version bumped to 0.3.0

### Phase 1A of epic #83

- New schema `inst/schema/v1/sessions.sql` — PIT sessions table with `valid_from NOT NULL`, primary key, two indexes.
- `R/schema.R` — `schema_version()`, `apply_schema_v1()`, `open_telemetry_db()` exported helpers.
- `R/rollup_sessions.R` — backfills sessions from `unified_sessions.json` into v1 Parquet via duckplyr + DuckDB COPY TO (no arrow dependency).
- `inst/scripts/run_rollup.R` — CLI runner; produces 329-row initial parquet.
- `inst/extdata/telemetry/v1/sessions.parquet` — first PIT data committed (329 rows, zstd compression).
- Tests: 5 schema tests + 8 rollup tests (column set, valid_from, round-trip, idempotency, error on empty input).
- Version bumped to 0.2.0; `withr` added to Suggests.

## 2026-05-13 to 2026-05-16 (session: dashboard-refresh-and-telemetry-epic)

### Completed
- **Issue #26 / PR #56** — unified.duckdb migration via `DBI::dbReadTable()`; 20 new tests.
- **Issue #27 dashboard refresh** (CLOSED) — Phase 2 (#66) added 4 new exports (`weekly_commits_by_project`, `cost_per_commit`, `file_churn`, `change_coupling`); Phase 3 (#67) added granularity toggle, 90-day default `dataZoom`, replaced 10 value_boxes with 3 compact summary tables, added 4 new chart cards including coupling force-graph; hotfix in same PR for E1/E2 Git tab card heights, D1 block_table sort, B3 ec_line y-axis rescale.
- **Issue #68 project filter epic** (CLOSED) — Phase A (#76) added `canonicalize_project()` helper, `canonical_project` column on 7 exports, new `projects_master.json` stable list; Phase B (#77) wired multi-select `selectInput(multiple=TRUE, selectize=FALSE, size=10)` populated ONCE from master list, 7 outputs reactive to filter, fixes time-horizon stickiness.
- **PR #71** — QA grep error patterns (`no method`, `S3 class:`, `could not find function`, `object .* not found`) in both `inst/scripts/qa_dashboard_content.sh` and `.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yaml` verify-deployment step.
- **Epic #83 Phase 0** (PR #84 merged) — added `shinylive` R package to nix shell (default.R + regenerated default.nix); Q3 gate prototype at `prototypes/duckdb-wasm/` validates DuckDB-WASM + WebR coexistence in same browser tab. Phase 0 verdict: PASS. Architecture validated for the push-to-PIT-parquet telemetry DB design.

### Bug fixes within PR #77
- Server-crash `observe(..., once=TRUE)`: invalid arg, replaced with `local({...})`.
- `commits_by_proj` "arguments imply differing number of rows: 0, 1" — defensive: use `names(splits)[i]` for Project, coerce numeric columns, guard empty groups.
- `base_url` hardcoded to gh-pages: local renders were fetching production data. Now `""` (same-origin) — works for local + prod identically.
- Bus Factor / File Growth caption renames (6 Months → 1 Month, 6-Month → 1-Week) — label-only; server-side window unchanged.

### Issues filed (open at session end)
- #72 multi-source coverage (Claude + Gemini + codex)
- #73 Cost per Commit Trend "no data available"
- #74 Git tab layout — tabsets or split
- #75 caption on every chart per visualisation standard
- #78 Gemini data is stale
- #79 per-project token aggregation
- #80 cumulative cost (B+C epic)
- #81 Git charts only show llm/llmtelemetry — backfill needed
- #82 Calibration tab not reactive to time filters
- #83 **EPIC** centralised push-based telemetry DB — Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 pending

Of these, #72, #78, #79, #80 are downstream of #83's push architecture — likely dissolved when Phase 1 ships.

### Lessons learned (preserved in `.claude/CURRENT_WORK.md`)
- `quarto render` exit 0 ≠ render success: shinylive Lua filter errors are swallowed; always grep rendered HTML for expected content.
- WebR rlang 1.1.6 pin means dplyr/duckplyr cannot run client-side; dashboard query layer must use pre-built VIEWS executed via DuckDB-WASM minimal SQL (rule-compliant exemption).
- HF `hf://` row-group queries fail browser CORS preflight (huggingface/datasets#7931) — gh-pages must be the dashboard's live query target, HF stays as long-term archive.
- shinylive's `<pre class="shinylive-r">` "warning" text in rendered HTML is normal; the JS runtime replaces it with the widget at page load (10–30s WebR cold start).
- `default.R` `project_path` should be `"."` not a hardcoded sibling path — otherwise regens land in the wrong checkout.

### Build / infrastructure changes
- `default.R` adds `shinylive` to `r_pkgs`; `project_path = "."` (was hardcoded sibling).
- `default.nix` regenerated to include shinylive 0.3.0 + transitive deps.
- Prototypes at `prototypes/duckdb-wasm/` preserved on main as reference for Phase 1.

## 2026-05-12 (session: roborev-triage-and-maintenance)

### Completed
- **Backup infrastructure** (PR #61): created private `JohnGavin/llmtelemetry-data` repo as
  second-copy backup target; `scripts/backup_extdata.sh` syncs `inst/extdata/` and
  `vignettes/data/` there idempotently; filled all `<TODO>` placeholders in `RECOVERY.md`
  with actual paths, failure-domain note, and restore steps.
- **Version bump** (PR #61): `DESCRIPTION` `0.0.0.9000` → `0.1.0` (project is live/prod).
- **Roborev triage**: sampled all 40 failing verdicts; closed 2 false positives (jobs 1056,
  1052 — reviewer didn't see prior-commit otelsdk work); categorised remaining 38.
- **QA script bugs** (PR #62): `curl -sL` without `--fail` allowed HTTP 404 to pass silently
  as "OK" (HIGH, job #905); `$TODAY` used before initialization under `set -u` caused unbound-
  variable abort when sessions data was empty (MEDIUM, job #996).
- **Project filter + email NaN** (PR #63): "None" button showed all projects instead of none —
  `length > 0` guard on 9 filter sites bypassed empty selection (jobs #982, #989); replaced
  `is.na(cost_per_mtok) <- 0` with `is.nan()` so genuine missing rows render "-" not "$0.00"
  (job #897).
- **ARIA + fullscreen sweep** (PR #64): `ec()` `role="img"` → `role="button"` + `tabindex="0"`
  + keyboard handler (Enter/Space); `ec_scatter()` and bespoke `block_timeline` chart were
  entirely missing ARIA and fullscreen — both now have same pattern (jobs #946, #940).
- **Timestamp normalization** (PR #65): `ended_at < started_at` in exported sessions (ccusage
  UTC/local timezone mismatch); `pmax(ended_at, started_at)` before `as.character()` conversion
  keeps fields monotonic (job #1055).

### Failed Approaches
- `rsync` via `command -v rsync` in backup script: `openrsync` wrapper resolves but can't exec
  the underlying `rsync` binary in the Nix shell context — exit 14. Switched to `cp -R` with
  pre-deletion of destination dirs.
- `/usr/bin/rsync` directly: same openrsync wrapper issue. `cp -R` with clear-then-copy is the
  reliable macOS/Nix workaround.

### Accuracy / Metrics
- Roborev: 51 total, 8 passed, 43 failed, **2 addressed** (up from 0) this session.
  5 PRs in review address jobs #905, #996, #982, #989, #897, #946, #940, #1055 (8 more verdicts).
  Projected pass rate after merges: ~16/51 ≈ 31% (up from 13%).

### Known Limitations
- 5 PRs (#61–#65) open but not yet merged; session work lands on merge.
- Remaining ~9 open roborev verdicts: JS formatter serialized as JSON string in `ec()` tooltip
  (job #982), missing regression tests (#905, #897), `investigate_58.R` overstatement (#1033),
  and investigation-branch items.
- Backup repo in same GitHub account — not protected against account-level loss (noted in
  `RECOVERY.md`; higher-assurance option is rclone to Backblaze B2).
- `scripts/backup_extdata.sh` not yet on a daily schedule (manual run only).

## 2026-05-12 (session: fix-issue-59-nix-otelsdk)

### Completed
- Built `otelsdk` (OpenTelemetry C++ SDK wrapper, GitHub-only) as a manual Nix
  derivation in `default.nix` (issue #59, PR #60). `library(otelsdk)` now loads
  cleanly from `nix-shell default.nix`.
- Added `default.post.sh`: idempotent script that re-applies the `otelsdk` derivation
  block after any future `rix::rix()` regeneration of `default.nix`.
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) with full history back to 2026-02-21.
- Created `NIX.md`: Nix environment reference — adding packages, updating the `otelsdk`
  rev, reverting `default.nix`, known issues and workarounds.

### Failed Approaches
- `postPatch` on `src/CMakeLists.txt` — file does not exist in the package root;
  it lives inside `src/vendor/opentelemetry-cpp.tgz` (extracted at build time, not
  at patch time). The patch hook runs before the tarball is unpacked.
- `postPatch` on `CMakeLists.txt` (no path prefix) — same result, wrong location.
- Setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` with semicolons in `preBuild` — semicolons are bash
  statement separators inside Makefile recipes; the remaining path segments after the
  first semicolon were executed as shell commands, producing "Is a directory" errors.
- `postPatch` with `sed` to comment out `include(cmake/googletest.cmake)` in
  `src/CMakeLists.txt` — same "no such file" problem as above.

### Root cause
`-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF` is already present in `src/Makevars.in`'s cmake invocation,
and `CMakeLists.txt` does guard the googletest include inside `if(BUILD_TESTING)`.
However cmake 4.1.2 evaluates `FetchContent_MakeAvailable` at configure time before
the `BUILD_TESTING` guard fully suppresses it. Adding
`-DFETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED=ON` to the cmake invocation (via a `sed` patch on
`src/Makevars.in`) prevents all FetchContent network downloads unconditionally.

### Accuracy / Metrics
- `library(otelsdk)` loads from `nix-shell default.nix --run "Rscript -e '...'"`: ✓
- Build time: ~45 seconds (cmake + C++ compile)

### Known Limitations
- `RECOVERY.md` backup destinations are still TODO (backup infra not yet configured).
- 37 pre-existing roborev verdicts unaddressed (pre-date this session).
- `DESCRIPTION` still at `0.0.0.9000` — needs bump before first public deploy.

## 2026-05-12

### Added
- `otelsdk` R package (GitHub-only, wraps OpenTelemetry C++ SDK 1.22.0) built as a
  manual Nix derivation in `default.nix` (issue #59, PR #60)
  - `nativeBuildInputs`: `which`, `cmake`, `protobuf_21`, `pkg-config`, `curl`, `curl.dev`,
    `zlib`, `zlib.dev`
  - `preBuild`: exports `$CMAKE` so configure skips `which cmake` (not in Nix sandbox PATH)
  - `postPatch`: patches `src/Makevars.in` to add `-DFETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED=ON`
    (prevents googletest git-clone, which is blocked in the Nix derivation sandbox)
  - `default.post.sh`: idempotent script that re-applies the otelsdk block after any
    future `Rscript default.R` / `rix::rix()` regeneration (see `NIX.md`)
- `.gitignore` entries: `.Renviron`, common IDE and OS files
- OTEL env-var stubs in `.Renviron.example` for issue #59 context
