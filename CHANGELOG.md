## 2026-05-12 (session: fix-issue-59-nix-otelsdk)

### Completed
- Built `otelsdk` (OpenTelemetry C++ SDK wrapper, GitHub-only) as a manual Nix
  derivation in `default.nix` (issue #59, PR #60). `library(otelsdk)` now loads
  cleanly from `nix-shell default.nix`.
- Added `default.post.sh`: idempotent script that re-applies the `otelsdk` derivation
  block after any future `rix::rix()` regeneration of `default.nix`.
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) with full history back to 2026-02-21.
- Created `NIX.md`: Nix environment reference — adding packages, updating the `otelsdk`
  rev, reverting `default.nix`, known issues and workarounds.

### Failed Approaches
- `postPatch` on `src/CMakeLists.txt` — file does not exist in the package root;
  it lives inside `src/vendor/opentelemetry-cpp.tgz` (extracted at build time, not
  at patch time). The patch hook runs before the tarball is unpacked.
- `postPatch` on `CMakeLists.txt` (no path prefix) — same result, wrong location.
- Setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` with semicolons in `preBuild` — semicolons are bash
  statement separators inside Makefile recipes; the remaining path segments after the
  first semicolon were executed as shell commands, producing "Is a directory" errors.
- `postPatch` with `sed` to comment out `include(cmake/googletest.cmake)` in
  `src/CMakeLists.txt` — same "no such file" problem as above.

### Root cause
`-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF` is already present in `src/Makevars.in`'s cmake invocation,
and `CMakeLists.txt` does guard the googletest include inside `if(BUILD_TESTING)`.
However cmake 4.1.2 evaluates `FetchContent_MakeAvailable` at configure time before
the `BUILD_TESTING` guard fully suppresses it. Adding
`-DFETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED=ON` to the cmake invocation (via a `sed` patch on
`src/Makevars.in`) prevents all FetchContent network downloads unconditionally.

### Accuracy / Metrics
- `library(otelsdk)` loads from `nix-shell default.nix --run "Rscript -e '...'"`: ✓
- Build time: ~45 seconds (cmake + C++ compile)

### Known Limitations
- `RECOVERY.md` backup destinations are still TODO (backup infra not yet configured).
- 37 pre-existing roborev verdicts unaddressed (pre-date this session).
- `DESCRIPTION` still at `0.0.0.9000` — needs bump before first public deploy.

## 2026-05-12

### Added
- `otelsdk` R package (GitHub-only, wraps OpenTelemetry C++ SDK 1.22.0) built as a
  manual Nix derivation in `default.nix` (issue #59, PR #60)
  - `nativeBuildInputs`: `which`, `cmake`, `protobuf_21`, `pkg-config`, `curl`, `curl.dev`,
    `zlib`, `zlib.dev`
  - `preBuild`: exports `$CMAKE` so configure skips `which cmake` (not in Nix sandbox PATH)
  - `postPatch`: patches `src/Makevars.in` to add `-DFETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED=ON`
    (prevents googletest git-clone, which is blocked in the Nix derivation sandbox)
  - `default.post.sh`: idempotent script that re-applies the otelsdk block after any
    future `Rscript default.R` / `rix::rix()` regeneration (see `NIX.md`)
- `.gitignore` entries: `.Renviron`, common IDE and OS files
- OTEL env-var stubs in `.Renviron.example` for issue #59 context
